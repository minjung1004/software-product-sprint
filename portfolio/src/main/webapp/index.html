      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img id= "min_pic" src="images/min_pic.jpg" />
      <p>My name is Min. I am 19 years old. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, 
          California to Korean immigrant parents. I have a sister who is a year older 
          than me and 5 years younger brother, making me the middle child. From 
          childhood till the present, I enjoy participating in sports such as Tae Kwon Do, 
          volleyball, tennis, badminton, table tennis, and softball. I like trying various 
          sports; however, I'd prefer if the activities were indoors. Despite living in 
          Southern California since birth, I do not like the heat. I believe that the 
          perfect temperature is 72 degrees Fahrenheit! Nevertheless, this summer I'd like 
          to try learning how to surf! </p>

      <p>A question I find embarrassing or cautious to answer is "Did you learn how to 
          play an instrument?". The reason being is because I definitely did learn but I 
          can not play it. Coming from an Asian family, learning the piano was one the must 
          to-dos as a child. I took piano lessons for 6 years and for the life of me, I still 
          can not read the music notes. It is safe to say I never got passed the beginner's 
          books. It's crazy but I was really doing my best to survive the lessons and get my 
          candy at the end. In the end, the candy was more important than the piano to me. I 
          also learned the cello; however, that had the same ending as the piano. But, now I 
          am interested in the guitar, especially the classical guitars, and want to learn to 
          play. Maybe third time is the charm and now that candies are not that important to 
          me</p>
        
      <p>Currently, my family and I reside in Northridge which is in the San Fernando Valley. 
          Although Cal State Northridge is closer to home, I decided to attend Cal Poly Pomona 
          to avoid going to the same school as my older sister again and to gain some 
          independence. Currently, I am an incoming junior studying Computer Science aiming to 
          graduate in Spring 2024. While my first year and a half of my college experience were 
          online, I tried to experience the most by taking all the opportunities I can. I joined 
          the club sheCodes and became the treasurer for 2021-2022 and now the elected vice 
          president for 2022-2023. While in the club, I participated in 2 Semester Long Projects 
          (SLP), and 2 outreach programs, Future Women Developers Conference. I also joined side 
          projects such as the Northrup Grumman Collaboration Projects, Big Data and Cloud 
          Computing Apprenciship(BDCC), STARs Research project, Target Women in Tech Symposium 
          Hackathon, etc.</p>
        
      <p>For the 2022-2023 school year, I will be studying abroad at Yonsei University in South 
          Korea. While at Yonsei, I will continue studying computer science and also improve my 
          Korean language skills. As I advance my knowledge academically, I will also experience 
          a step-up of my independence and learn how to navigate to survive in a new living 
          condition for a year. My goal for next year is to become a more knowledgeable person 
          both in my academic area and personal life! Especially my personal life, because I 
          still feel like I have not grown much since high school (when covid started).</p>

        or two things about me!</p>
